beta-VAE: A Tale Of Reconstruction and Disentanglement

It was early in the 2010s and Disentanglement was happily and safely sat in his
throne content in the knowledge that no model could ever touch him. Whilst the
machine learning community had successfully apprehended Reconstruction years
earlier with their new VAE technology, he was so safe he once said "Look, they
can't even tell a chair is still a chair when you rotate it a little!" Lone
behold his confidence was unjustified. A revolution had erupted in the town
below, beta-VAE had been proposed. Disentanglement knew he was doomed, so he
proposed a deal to the townspeople: do not fight me, let me fight
Reconstruction!

Reconstruction and Disentanglement fought and fought and after
years of fighting there was no clear winner. The people grew tired of the
fighting and having to constantly decide which leader they wanted to approach.

They wondered and wondered how they could brocker peace. Finally, peace was
finally struck in 2016 when the community invented GANs. They said to their
leaders: "Reconstruction and Disentanglement, we no longer have to choose
between you - we can have you both". And from that day on they governed as
co-Kings and lived happily ever after. The End.
